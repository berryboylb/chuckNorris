### This is a summary of how i arranged my project.

```markdown
**Steps:**

# 1) Set up a basic react app and install needed packages.

# 2) Setup a layout for the pages, which includes the hero section, navbar and footer.

# 3)setup a A store for called jokes which contains this fields, singleJoke,

# categories,

# suggestions,

# loading,

# error. Also actions that would be used to change their state

# 4) Get all the categories and assign them colors before displaying

# 5) Use this categories to make suggestions to users when searching.

# 6) Get all the jokes and their categories, if the catgories array is empty then it is added to uncategoried jokes

# 7) Create a view more for both categories and jokes which emulates a looad more button that is incresing the size of an already spliced array.

# 8) Get a single joke by the id of the joke and display suggestions.

# 9) after getting a joke by category, still filter by that category, before checking the length, i

# if the length is greater than one just dispatch the items normally else if it is equal to zero # dispatch empty array else dispatch a single object and redirect to the single joke page.

# 10) if the category of the joke is not explicit or uncategorized then get suggestions by the category, else get all.

# 11) Add a counter for the reactions button.

# 12) Deliver quality code that is clear, simple, well-tested, bug-free, refactored and performant.
